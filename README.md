# JudgeScoreAverager v1.0
Judge Score Averager GUI is a remake of my first ever C# program made in Visual C#. It allows users to take scores from multiple judges of a contest and average them out for a final score.

## Features

* Up to 999 Judges. (Dunno why you'd have that many.)
* Highscore to prevent any scores from going higher than the set one.
* Easy to navigate gui.
* Save your averages into text files!
* Averages out to the 3rd decimal point. (if applicable.)
